# Self-Driving Car ðŸš—
## Overview
This project is a simulation of a self-driving car that utilizes computer vision and AI to navigate through a virtual environment. The car uses a neural network to detect obstacles, make decisions, and move autonomously in the simulation.

## Features
- Autonomous Navigation: The car can steer and avoid obstacles on its own using real-time sensor data.
- Neural Network: Implemented a machine learning model for decision-making based on input from simulated sensors.
- Simulation Environment: The car operates within a virtual environment built using Vanilla JavaScript.
